# dev

My development tool. It helps with creating new projects from a template, managing the configuration of those projects, and more!

**Linting**

- changelog
- `npm-package-json-lint`
- packageJson
  - accurate license (read file system)
  - accurate description (read from github?)
- packageJson.bin alphabetical if object
- Function like `filesMustHaveContent`, but renames lefthook.yml, lefthook.json to lefthook.yaml, etc.
