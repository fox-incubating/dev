- .github repo specific errors
- github test if org has all files archived (fox-archived)
- .github/funding.yml and all file checks for orgs
- nodejs: check for .format, .lint properties and .eslint, .prettier props in package.json. make sure they are consistent (decide)
- private npm repositories run less rules (do not popular packageJson)
- check for unecessary files github
- np (sindresorhus)
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT etc. does not start with newline (copy paste error?)
- check that "private" field exists packageJson
- lefthook
- `npm-package-json-lint`
