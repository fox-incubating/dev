# dev

My development tool. It helps with creating new projects from a template, managing the configuration of those projects, and more!

## TODO

- default manager?

**Linting**

- changelog
- lefthook
- `npm-package-json-lint`
- packageJson
  - accurate license (read file system)
  - accurate description (read from github?)
- packageJson.bin alphabetical if object
- Remove reading of `project.toml`, etc. `foxxo.toml` (`fox-dev.toml`)
- flag to enable-disable certain checks during development
- check caps of jsconfig.json
