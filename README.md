# dev

My development tool. I use this for all my projects. It helps with creating new projects from a template and managing the configuration of those projects.

## TODO

- org: .github repo specific errors
- org: github test if org has all files archived (fox-archived)
- org: .github/funding.yml and all file checks for orgs
- lefthook
- validate licenses
- `npm-package-json-lint`
- packageJson
  - accurate license (read file system)
  - accurate description (read from github?)
- packageJson.bin alphabetical if object
- Remove reading of `project.toml`, etc. `foxxo.toml` (`fox-dev.toml`)
- flag to enable-disable certain checks
